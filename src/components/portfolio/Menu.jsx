It is designed to help combat the issue of contaminated recyclables. \nUsers will be able to take a picture of the object they want to recycle, and the app will be able to differentiate recyclables from non-recyclables, additionally, it can also recommend users on what to do with non-recyclables - like dropping off a toy ball at an orphanage or thrift store.

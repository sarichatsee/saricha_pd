        desc: "Inspired by the iconic openings of beloved RPGs, particularly The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, my VR escape room transports players into a mystical world where they awaken in an ancient sanctuary. To reach the open world beyond, players must solve intricate musical puzzles, navigate teleportation pads, and master potion mixing, mirroring the classic RPG challenge of preparation before exploration. Developed in Unity, I used complex logic for scenario-based color changes, object spawning, and dynamic transitions. This project was both intensive and deeply rewarding, blending my love for RPG storytelling with the challenge of immersive puzzle design.",

It is designed to help combat the issue of contaminated recyclables. \nUsers will be able to take a picture of the object they want to recycle, and the app will be able to differentiate recyclables from non-recyclables, additionally, it can also recommend users on what to do with non-recyclables - like dropping off a toy ball at an orphanage or thrift store.
